## VaultX

**Description**  
VaultX is a Bash script designed to gather and display critical operational information from a HashiCorp Vault cluster. It provides detailed insights into Vault cluster nodes, Raft autopilot state, replication status, license information, and more, all formatted in a color-coded and easy-to-read display.

### Features:
- **Cluster Node Discovery**: Automatically detects and lists all nodes within the Vault cluster.
- **Vault Status**: Retrieves and displays the status of each node in the cluster.
- **Raft Information**: Provides details about Raft peers and the autopilot configuration/state.
- **Replication Status**: Displays the current replication status in JSON format.
- **License Information**: Retrieves and shows Vault's license information.
- **Colorized Output**: Key details are highlighted in various colors for better readability.

### Prerequisites:
- **jq**: The script requires `jq` to process JSON data. The script includes functionality to automatically install `jq` if it's not already present on your system.
- **Vault CLI**: You must have the Vault CLI installed and configured for this script to work.

### Installation:
To install `jq` (if not already installed), the script will detect your package manager (e.g., `apt-get`, `yum`, `dnf`, or `zypper`) and attempt to install it. Alternatively, you can install it manually using one of the following commands based on your system:
```bash
sudo apt-get install jq    # For Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install jq        # For RHEL/CentOS
sudo dnf install jq        # For Fedora
sudo zypper install jq     # For SUSE
```

### Usage:
1. **Vault Token**: If your VAULT_TOKEN is set as an environment variable, it will be used to display the result. Otherwise, youâ€™ll be prompted to enter your Vault token for authentication to access the Vault cluster.
2. The script will automatically discover nodes in the Vault cluster and display their statuses along with other critical operational details.

### Example:
Run the script using the command:
```bash
./vaultx.sh
```
You will be prompted to enter your Vault token unless it's already set as an environment variable, after which the script will display the following information:
- Vault status for each node in the cluster.
- Raft peer details.
- Vault license information.
- Raft autopilot state and configuration.
- Replication status (if applicable).

### Output Sample:
- Cluster nodes and their statuses.
- Raft peer details and autopilot state.
- Replication status (in JSON format).

This script simplifies monitoring and managing a HashiCorp Vault cluster by consolidating essential information into a single interface for quick and easy reference.
